## Bayesian analysis of "multiplicative" model

The work here includes several files pertaining to the Bayesian analysis of the "multiplicative" model presented in a recently submitted paper on children's knowledge of cardinality (vanMarle, Chu, Mou, Seok, Rouder, & Geary, under review). Please see article [appendix](mult_appendix.pdf) for modeling details.

## Project overview

Children’s understanding of the quantities represented by number words (i.e., cardinality) is related to one or two core, inherent systems – the approximate number system (ANS) and the object tracking system (OTS) – but whether these systems act alone, in concert, or antagonistically is debated. In the paper, we use classical (logit regression) and Bayesian methods to assess the importance of the ANS and the OTS to children's early understanding of cardinality at two separate time points. Results support the notion that both systems initially contribute to children’s early mapping of number words to cardinal value, however, the role of the OTS diminishes over time while that of the ANS continues to support cardinal knowledge.
